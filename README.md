# Exxon-Mobil-Stock-Analysis-and-Prediction

### Introduction
Exxon Mobil Corporation, is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas.

The company explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas in the United States, Canada/South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia/Oceania. It also manufactures and markets commodity petrochemicals, including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics, and specialty products; and transports and sells crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. Exxon Mobil Corporation was formerly known as Exxon Corporation and changed its name to Exxon Mobil Corporation in November, 1999.

A trend of bearish technical signs has been illustrated by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM). We are careful as global oil prices continue to fall and production is still at a very high historical level. 

In the second quarter, Exxon Mobil Corp.'s profit dropped by half on sharply lower oil and gas prices around the world, but the company's oil and gas production, which has typically declined in recent years, increased.

In this project, we analyze the ExxonMobil’s stock price with respect to its competitors and predict the Exxon’s stock price.
